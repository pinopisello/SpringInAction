/**
 * A SecurityHeaderException indicates that there is a problem with the
 * security header elements and subelements.
 * It indicates that there is an error in the input message to a MessageFilter.  
 * For example, a ds:keyInfo element may not contain a reference to a
 * security token. If such a reference is missing, then to
 * indicate this problem, an instance of this Exception would be thrown.
 * 
 * <p>
 * This is as opposed to a problem with processing the message itself.  An
 * example would be a MessageFilter that needs to look up data in a
 * database that is not currently available. A XWSSecurityException would
 * be thrown in the latter case.
